# myTrickster
## Description
This project aims to develop a front-end website for a fictional game company called My Trickster. The design process began with creating a prototype in Figma, which was then implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a visually appealing layout and interactive elements to enhance user experience.

To enrich the website's content, assets were sourced from the original game Temtem, providing a vibrant and engaging aesthetic.
