        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Quetzal is a large mining and manufacturing city, and the only city on Tucma, one of the islands in MyTrickStEr. Residents of Quetzal are known as Quetzaleño's, but are also pejoratively called "mine-worms" by the bandits that live on Tucma's surface. The beautiful city of Quetzal is illuminated by various crystal lights. The city is built on a series of platforms and walkways that span a massive cavern underneath the surface of the island. In addition to acting as the city's lampposts, crystals also protrude from the ground, and are embedded in trees that decorate several pathways in the city.
