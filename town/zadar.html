        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Zadar is the first area and town in the game. This is where the protagonist starts their adventure by receiving their first Creatures and meeting their rival. Zadar is a town in the south of Deniz that hosts many houses and a lab for studying Creatures. To the north is the Prasine Coast, a path that follows the shoreline. To the east you'll find a beach with a small pier, a perfect spot to watch the waves roll in. The southern end of the village are the cliffs where the island ends, and to the west is a dense forest.
