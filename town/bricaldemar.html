        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Brical de Mar is the first town on Deniz, where tamers begin their journey. It's a small coastal town with essential facilities like Temporium (item shop) and the Tamer's School. Brical de Mar is a large town located in the center of Deniz. It is home to the Accademia, the best place to start learning the basics of Temtem. To the west of the town is the Indigo Lake that is a perfect spot to swim or surf around. The east opens up to the Sillaro River and the largest docks on the island. To the north of the town stretch the Thalassian Cliffs.
