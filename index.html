                Deniz (”Mare Nostrum”) is a Mediterranean paradise of <br> 
                glittering seas where Water and Wind Creatures abound. <br>
                Walk the streets of Turquesa, explore the ruins of an <br>
                ancient fort or just chill.<br><br> 

                Throughout the Archipelago, Deniz has the reputation of a <br>
                beautiful island with amazing beaches, historic castles, <br>
                and majestic waters.

                Omninesia (”the Myrisles”) is a cluster of tropical islets <br> 
                connected by rope bridges, home of Nature and Fire <br> 
                Creatures.<br><br> 

                Omninesians create all kinds of foods and products from <br>
                natural resources. Omninesia also has a long tradition of <br>
                wind and percussion instruments, possibly influenced by its <br>
                population of Wind types.

                Tucma, “The End of All Things” - a vast desolation of ashes, <br>
                noxious lakes and Toxic Creatures. Under the surface, the <br> 
                mining city of Quetzal is home to artisans, rock-hoppers <br> 
                and Crystal Creatures.<br><br>

                A gas-mask is strongly recommended for the exploration <br> 
                of the surface of Tucma, as is avoiding the eastern <br> 
                Corrupted Badlands.

                Arbury (”The Alma Mater”) is an island in MyTrickStEr. Its <br> 
                pride is its University. The fierce dons of Lochburg swear by <br> 
                their Melee Creatures, against the sophisticated Properton <br> 
                academics, who favour Mental Creatures.<br><br>

                Arbury has traditionally been considered a melancholy land <br> 
                of constant rain, rolling green hills and endless academic <br> 
                quibbles.
